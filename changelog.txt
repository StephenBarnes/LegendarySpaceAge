Version: 0.7.0
Date: 2025-02-10
  Features:
    - Added "factor intermediates" (frame, panel, structure, fluid fitting, shielding, mechanism, sensor). These are intermediate items with multiple alternative recipes, and replace ingredients in infrastructure recipes, effectively allowing you to e.g. make pipes out of copper or transport belts out of plastic. This will enable zero-metal Gleba.
    - Added lots of stuff to Gleba - farmable stingfronds with cyclosome system, farmable slipstacks, farmable boompuffs, activated pentapod eggs, seed fertilization, petrophages, chitin, appendages, etc.
    - Added deep mining drill, using graphics from Hurricane046.
    - Added char furnace, and reorganized early-game tech tree.
    - Added automatic progression debug script, for debugging. This is disabled by default; edit global-params.lua to enable it. (TODO fix progression bugs)
    - TODO Added production rate triggers for all remaining science packs (except space science, which will be unlocked by building first space platform).
    - Filled barrels and tanks are now usable as fuel. Oxygen is no longer usable as fluid fuel.
    - Rails cannot be built on Aquilo.
    - Removed toggle hotkey.

Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2025-01-22
  Features:
    - Added "production rate research triggers" system, e.g. you need to produce 150 machine parts per minute to unlock red science. Currently added to red, green, blue, and military science; other sciences will be added later.
    - Added natural gas wells, using modified graphics from Adamo Carbon. They replace half the oil wells on Nauvis, and all the oil wells on Aquilo.
    - Adjusted world-gen preset in several ways. Resource patch settings resemble the rail-world preset.
    - Added check and notification when wrong map preset is used.
    - Added inverse vulcanization tech for cheaper plastic on Vulcanus after exporting science.
    - Reorganized early-game tech tree.
    - Various changes to recipes and techs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2025-01-17
  Features:
    - Added hotkey to toggle between offshore pump and waste pump, gasifier and fluid-fuelled gasifier, heating tower and fluid-fuelled heating tower. Removed separate items and recipes for the variants.
    - Gas vents in space can now also vent liquids.
    - Fulgora now has zero free oxygen, so burners can't be built. Water is no longer unobtainable.
    - Removed dependency on Fulgora Lives mod, rather incorporating into this mod, with changes that don't make sense for that mod standalone.
    - Added pressurized tanks for storing gases and some liquids. Removed fluid train wagons.
    - Added electric boiler (from other mod), for Fulgora.
    - Added new recipe chain for blue circuits, with silicon and doped wafers.
    - Added new recipe chain for red circuits, with "electronic components" intermediate.
    - Adjusted early-game tech tree.
    - Many other small changes.
    - Added some dependency mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2025-01-14
  Features:
    - Added hand-crank for early electricity (via other mod, updated to 2.0).
    - Added cement fluid for regular concrete, and molten-sulfur concrete for Vulcanus.
    - Added water filters, and filterable lake water on Nauvis, and slime on Gleba.
    - Added ammonia production on Nauvis.
    - Added early tree farming.
    - Added fertilizer.
    - Added briefing on tips-and-tricks screen.
    - Added niter for gunpowder, sourced from boulders, lake-water filtration, or ammonia.
    - Miscellaneous other changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-01-11
  Features:
    - Added glass and sand.
    - Added machine parts and advanced parts.
    - Added fluid-fuelled heating tower.
    - For Vulcanus, added volcanic gas, volcanic gas condensation/separation, lava-water heat exchange.
    - Revamped foundry smelting and casting recipes; added molten steel, molten tungsten, fluid heat puzzle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-01-09
  Features:
    - Added gunpowder.
    - Added gasifier (copying Adamo Carbon mod) and fluid-fuelled gasifier.
    - Added inline storage tank (from Tiny Storage Tanks mod).
    - Added liquid waste pump.
    - Added rubber.
    - Added fuel values for fluids, sulfur, and other fuels.
    - Adjusted early-game tech progression.
    - Adjusted recipes for some infrastructure - belts, undergrounds, splitters, vehicles.
    - Miscellaneous other changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
