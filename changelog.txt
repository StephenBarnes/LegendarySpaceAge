    - Added air separator, which produces different gases on each planet, and can't be placed near other air separators.
    - Added condensing steam turbine (intended for space platforms, Vulcanus, and eventually moons).
    - Added arc furnace for making molten metals. Foundry now only casts molten metals.
    - Added quality scaling of power consumption for gasifiers, char furnaces, and battery chargers, to remove infinite-energy exploits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 2025-02-25
  Features:
    - Added primer building and superclocker building. Removed modules, which are now replaced with primed and superclocked circuits, which spoil. Added white circuits.
    - Added filtration plant.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash from missing hourglass signal icon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 2025-02-20
  Features:
    - Added "factor intermediates" like frame, structure, mechanism, etc. These are intermediate items with multiple alternative recipes, and replace ingredients in most building recipes, effectively allowing you to e.g. make pipes out of copper or transport belts out of plastic.
    - Added lots of stuff to Gleba - farmable stingfronds with cyclosome system, farmable slipstacks, farmable boompuffs, activated pentapod eggs, seed fertilization, petrophages, chitin, appendages, etc. Biochambers take damage while inactive. Removed metal bacteria, so there's no renewable sources of metals.
    - Added borehole mining drill, using graphics from Hurricane046.
    - Added char furnace, and reorganized early-game tech tree.
    - Added automatic progression debug script, for debugging. This is disabled by default; edit data/autodebug/main.lua to enable it.
    - Added shotgun turrets.
    - Added basic beacons, and moved beacons to earlier in the game.
    - Filled barrels and tanks are now usable as fuel. Oxygen is no longer usable as fluid fuel.
    - Rails cannot be built on Aquilo.
    - Removed toggle hotkey.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2025-01-22
  Features:
    - Added "production rate research triggers" system, e.g. you need to produce 150 machine parts per minute to unlock red science. Currently added to red, green, blue, and military science; other sciences will be added later.
    - Added natural gas wells, using modified graphics from Adamo Carbon. They replace half the oil wells on Nauvis, and all the oil wells on Aquilo.
    - Adjusted world-gen preset in several ways. Resource patch settings resemble the rail-world preset.
    - Added check and notification when wrong map preset is used.
    - Added inverse vulcanization tech for cheaper plastic on Vulcanus after exporting science.
    - Reorganized early-game tech tree.
    - Various changes to recipes and techs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2025-01-17
  Features:
    - Added hotkey to toggle between offshore pump and waste pump, gasifier and fluid-fuelled gasifier, heating tower and fluid-fuelled heating tower. Removed separate items and recipes for the variants.
    - Gas vents in space can now also vent liquids.
    - Fulgora now has zero free oxygen, so burners can't be built. Water is no longer unobtainable.
    - Removed dependency on Fulgora Lives mod, rather incorporating into this mod, with changes that don't make sense for that mod standalone.
    - Added pressurized tanks for storing gases and some liquids. Removed fluid train wagons.
    - Added electric boiler (from other mod), for Fulgora.
    - Added new recipe chain for blue circuits, with silicon and doped wafers.
    - Added new recipe chain for red circuits, with "electronic components" intermediate.
    - Adjusted early-game tech tree.
    - Many other small changes.
    - Added some dependency mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added water filters, and filterable lake water on Nauvis, and slime on Gleba.
    - Added ammonia production on Nauvis.
    - Added early tree farming.
    - Added fertilizer.
    - Added briefing on tips-and-tricks screen.
