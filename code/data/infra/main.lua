--[[ This folder adjusts numbers for all infrastructure buildings, etc., by group.
Aims:
* Create more interesting tradeoffs. E.g. sometimes you should prefer assembler 1's and 2's even when you have 3's.
* Generally I want even numbers so production rates are simple numbers.
* Generally increase electricity usages to make the game a bit harder. (Formerly used PowerMultiplier mod. But rather not using that, rather just set them all separately.)
