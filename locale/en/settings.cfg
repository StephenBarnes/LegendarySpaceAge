[mod-setting-description]
;LSA-force-settings=If enabled, LSA will configure the settings of other dependency mods, and then hide the settings from you. If this is disabled, LSA will only set the default values of those settings, and won't hide them, so you can configure them yourself. Some values of those settings could break LSA's intended balance or create bugs.
LSA-remove-mapgen-presets=If enabled, all map presets except the default and the LSA preset will be removed, to avoid confusion.
LSA-enable-detailed-apollo-terrain-sliders=Adds more sliders for controlling Apollo terrain generation (e.g. crater size and density). These were originally added for mod development. Enabling them might slightly slow down terrain generation.
