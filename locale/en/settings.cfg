[mod-setting-description]
LSA-remove-mapgen-presets=If enabled, all map presets except the default and the LSA preset will be removed, to avoid confusion.
LSA-enable-detailed-apollo-terrain-sliders=Adds more sliders for controlling Apollo terrain generation (e.g. crater size and density). These were originally added for mod development. Enabling them might slightly slow down terrain generation.
