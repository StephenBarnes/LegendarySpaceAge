[technology-description]
; Biolab can only be placed on space platforms
biolab=Biter eggs can be cultivated to create biolabs. Biolabs can only be placed on space platforms.
; Nitpicking text for the "Cargo Pod Requires Research" mod
gleba-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Gleba.
fulgora-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Fulgora.
vulcanus-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Vulcanus.
; Bacteria cultivation tech - note you can only get them from rocks (stromatolites), and we've added filtering recipes.
bacteria-cultivation=Copper and iron bacteria can be found in stromatolites on Gleba. Once a starter culture is obtained, they can be multiplied using bioflux, then aged to produce ores. Partially-spoiled bacteria can be filtered to separate fresh bacteria from ore.
; Improve the half-assed descriptions of new science packs, following descriptions of earlier science packs.
agricultural-science-pack=Allows research of biologically-inspired technologies such as spidertrons and biolabs, as well as processes to support biochambers on other planets.
electromagnetic-science-pack=Allows research of new electromagnetic technologies, with applications to equipment, robotics, and defense.
metallurgic-science-pack=Allows research into the applications of new materials, such as artillery, cliff explosives, and faster transport belts.
; Remaking toxophage tech from Biochemistry mod.
toxophages=Even in the hollowed-out ruins of Fulgora, life can still be found. With proper care, a starter culture of waste-eating bacteria can be cultivated to produce a self-sustaining supply of nutrients, enabling local bio-industry.
; Holmium battery tech
holmium-battery=With holmium, you can design batteries with much greater energy capacity and perfect reliability.
