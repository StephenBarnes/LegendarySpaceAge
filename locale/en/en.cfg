; Bacteria cultivation tech - note you can only get them from rocks (stromatolites), and we've added filtering recipes.
bacteria-cultivation=Copper and iron bacteria can be found in stromatolites on Gleba. Once a starter culture is obtained, they can be multiplied using bioflux, then aged to produce ores. Partially-spoiled bacteria can be filtered to separate fresh bacteria from ore.

; For Slipstack Agriculture mod
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks produce pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in shallow blue water or pink/purple marshlands. Slipstacks are a renewable source of stone and pearls, which have applications in bio-manufacturing. They also absorb spores, reducing attacks.
; For Power Overload
electric-energy-distribution-1=Electric poles with greater capacity and further reach, and fuses and transformers to connect networks.
electric-energy-distribution-2=Substations have capacity between medium and large electric poles, but can supply a much larger area.
po-electric-energy-distribution-3=Pylons have much greater electric capacity, and longer wire reach.
; Assembly machine 2 now comes after chem plants, so remove note about handling fluid ingredients.
automation-2=Improved technology for automatic mass production.
; Heating tower no longer has "very high efficiency", so edit tech description.
heating-tower=Buildings to generate heat from burnable solids and fluids, and use that heat to create steam and generate power.
; Modular armor is now not the first armor with an armor grid, so update description.
modular-armor=Armor with a grid for equipment modules and an inventory size bonus. Unlike earlier armors which only allowed batteries, solar panels, and roboports, modular armor also allows combat and defense equipment.
; Electric mining drill tech has no description.
electric-mining-drill=Electric mining drills have double the speed of burner drills, and create less pollution per mined ore.

; Biolabs
glebalab=Research facility with half the science pack drain of regular labs, and double the speed and module slots. Requires a steady supply of pentapod eggs.
biolab=Research facility with half the science pack drain of pentapod labs, and double the speed and module slots. Requires a steady supply of biter eggs. Can only be built in space.
; For slipstacks
slipstack=A coral stack that excretes blue blobs of mucus called pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
