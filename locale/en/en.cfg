po-electric-energy-distribution-3=Pylons have much greater electric capacity, and longer wire reach.
; Assembly machine 2 now comes after chem plants, so remove note about handling fluid ingredients.
automation-2=Improved technology for automatic mass production.
; Heating tower no longer has "very high efficiency", so edit tech description.
heating-tower=Buildings to generate heat from burnable solids and fluids, and use that heat to create steam and generate power.
; Modular armor is now not the first armor with an armor grid, so update description.
modular-armor=Armor with a grid for equipment modules and an inventory size bonus. Unlike earlier armors which only allowed batteries, generators, and roboports, modular armor also allows combat and defense equipment.
; Electric mining drill tech has no description.
electric-mining-drill=Electric mining drills have double the speed of burner drills, and create less pollution per mined ore.
; Adding tech for the personal burner generator.
personal-burner-generator=Your light armor can hold your personal roboport. Now you just need a way to power it.
personal-battery-generator=An efficient alternative to the personal burner generator, discharging batteries instead of burning fuel.
