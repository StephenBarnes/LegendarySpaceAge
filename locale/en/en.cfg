[technology-description]
; Biolab can only be placed on space platforms
biolab=Biter eggs can be cultivated to create biolabs. Biolabs can only be placed on space platforms.
; Nitpicking text for the "Cargo Pod Requires Research" mod
gleba-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Gleba.
fulgora-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Fulgora.
vulcanus-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Vulcanus.
; Bacteria cultivation tech - note you can only get them from rocks (stromatolites), and we've added filtering recipes.
bacteria-cultivation=Copper and iron bacteria can be found in stromatolites on Gleba. Once a starter culture is obtained, they can be multiplied using bioflux, then aged to produce ores. Partially-spoiled bacteria can be filtered to separate fresh bacteria from ore.
; Improve the half-assed descriptions of new science packs, following descriptions of earlier science packs.
agricultural-science-pack=Allows research of biologically-inspired technologies such as spidertrons and biolabs, as well as processes to support biochambers on other planets.
electromagnetic-science-pack=Allows research of new electromagnetic technologies, with applications to equipment, robotics, and defense.
metallurgic-science-pack=Allows research into the applications of new materials, such as artillery, cliff explosives, and faster transport belts.
; For Slipstack Agriculture mod
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks produce pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in shallow blue water or pink/purple marshlands. Slipstacks are a renewable source of stone and pearls, which have applications in bio-manufacturing. They also absorb spores, reducing attacks.
; For Power Overload
electric-energy-distribution-1=Electric poles with greater capacity and further reach, and fuses and transformers to connect networks.
electric-energy-distribution-2=Substations have capacity between medium and large electric poles, but can supply a much larger area.
po-electric-energy-distribution-3=Pylons have much greater electric capacity, and longer wire reach.

fulgoran-ruin-vault=Treasures left behind by a long-dead empire. When disturbed, a tough enemy will be spawned.
; Biolabs
glebalab=Research facility with half the science pack drain of regular labs, and double the speed and module slots. Requires a steady supply of pentapod eggs.
biolab=Research facility with half the science pack drain of pentapod biolabs, and double the speed and module slots. Requires a steady supply of biter eggs. Can only be built in space.
; For slipstacks
slipstack=A coral stack that excretes blue blobs of mucus called pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
; For Power Overload
po-transformer=Separates electric networks from each other, with 98% efficiency.
