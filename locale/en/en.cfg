biolab=Space biolab

[technology-description]
; Biolab can only be placed on space platforms
biolab=Biter eggs can be cultivated to create biolabs. Biolabs can only be placed on space platforms.
; Nitpicking text for the "Cargo Pod Requires Research" mod
gleba-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Gleba.
fulgora-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Fulgora.
vulcanus-atmosphere-navigation=Allows dropping pods with cargo onto Vulcanus.
; Bacteria cultivation tech - note you can only get them from rocks (stromatolites), and we've added filtering recipes.
bacteria-cultivation=Copper and iron bacteria can be found in stromatolites on Gleba. Once a starter culture is obtained, they can be multiplied using bioflux, then aged to produce ores. Partially-spoiled bacteria can be filtered to separate fresh bacteria from ore.
; Improve the half-assed descriptions of new science packs, following descriptions of earlier science packs.
agricultural-science-pack=Allows research of biologically-inspired technologies such as spidertrons and biolabs, as well as processes to support biochambers on other planets.
electromagnetic-science-pack=Allows research of new electromagnetic technologies, with applications to equipment, robotics, and defense.
metallurgic-science-pack=Allows research into the applications of new materials, such as artillery, cliff explosives, and faster transport belts.
; Remaking electrophage tech from Biochemistry mod.
electrophages=Even in the lightning-blasted ruins of Fulgora, life can still be found. With proper care, a starter culture of electrophages can be cultivated for a self-sustaining supply of nutrients, enabling local bio-industry.
; Holmium battery tech
holmium-battery=With holmium, you can make batteries that last forever and hold more energy. Unlike regular batteries, their charge will never spoil, and they are never destroyed by charging.
; For battery tech, we're adding chargers and dischargers.
battery=Batteries can be charged and discharged, allowing energy to be transported or saved for later. They can be used anywhere as an alternative to accumulators, which do not exist in this modpack.
; Fulgorite farming
fulgorite-farming=Fulgorites are coral-like structures formed by colonies of electrophages in symbiosis with a native fungus. They can be cultivated to produce holmium renewably.
