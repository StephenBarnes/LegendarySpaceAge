[technology-name]
electrolysis=Electrolysis
cryogenic-plant=Cryogenics

[technology-description]
electrolysis=Split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The process is energy-intensive but useful in places without abundant oxygen or hydrogen.
cryogenic-plant=Recipes for cooling fluids to extremely low temperatures.
cryogenic-plant-2=Regenerative cooling offers an alternative way to produce liquid nitrogen, after a small starting amount is available, at the cost of requiring more nitrogen gas as input.

[entity-description]
cryogenic-plant=Used for handling extremely low-temperature fluids and processes.
