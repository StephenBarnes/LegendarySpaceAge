basic-beacons=Basic beacons
effect-transmission=Advanced beacons

[technology-description]
basic-beacons=Beacons transmit the effects of modules to nearby machines. Multiple beacons have diminishing returns - see the graph in the Factoriopedia.
effect-transmission=Machines boosted by multiple beacons will get diminishing effects per beacon. However, the [item=beacon] and [item=basic-beacon] do not diminish each other's effects, so using both types in combination gives greater total effects. See the graphs in the Factoriopedia.

[entity-name]
basic-beacon=Basic beacon
beacon=Advanced beacon

[entity-description]
basic-beacon=Holds 4 modules whose effects are applied at 50% strength in the beacon's 5x5 area of effect. Beacons of the same type applying to the same machine will have diminishing returns.
beacon=Holds 8 modules whose effects are applied at 50% strength to all machines in the beacon's 9x9 area of effect. Beacons of the same type applying to the same machine will have diminishing returns. Basic and advanced beacons do not diminish each other's effects.
