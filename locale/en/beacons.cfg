effect-transmission-2=Advanced beacons

[technology-description]
effect-transmission=Beacons transmit the effects of modules to nearby machines. However, a machine can only be boosted by one beacon, otherwise it will become overloaded and stop working. Beacons can take speed or efficiency modules, but not productivity modules. The basic beacon has 4 module slots and a 7x7 area of effect, and transmits the effects of its modules at 50% strength.
effect-transmission-2=An upgrade to the basic beacon, with the same number of module slots (4) but double the effect strength (100%), and a larger area of effect (13x13). A machine can only be boosted by one beacon, otherwise it will become overloaded and stop working.
