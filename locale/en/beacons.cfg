[technology-description]
basic-beacons=In this modpack, primed circuits replace all modules. Use a [item=circuit-primer] to prime circuits, then put them in a [item=basic-beacon] to apply effects to nearby machines. Circuits will lose their priming over time, so you should use inserters to remove spent circuits and insert primed circuits. If a single machine is affected by many beacons, they will have diminishing returns - see the graph in the Factoriopedia. Later, you can research [technology=hyperprimed-circuits] and [technology=advanced-beacons].
effect-transmission=Advanced beacons broadcast 2 primed circuits over a 7x7 area. Although machines boosted by multiple beacons will get diminishing effects per beacon, the [item=beacon] and [item=basic-beacon] do not diminish each other's effects, so using both types in combination gives greater total effects. See the graph in the Factoriopedia.

basic-beacon=Broadcasts the effects of 1 primed circuit to machines in a 4x4 area. Beacons of the same type applying to the same machine will have diminishing returns.
beacon=Broadcasts the effects of 2 primed circuits to machines in a 7x7 area. Beacons of the same type applying to the same machine will have diminishing returns. Basic and advanced beacons do not diminish each other's effects.
