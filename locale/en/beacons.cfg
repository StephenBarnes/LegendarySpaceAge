basic-beacons=Basic beacons
effect-transmission=Advanced beacons

[technology-description]
basic-beacons=Beacons broadcast the effects of modules to nearby machines. Multiple beacons of the same type applying to the same machine will have diminishing returns - see the graph in the Factoriopedia.
effect-transmission=Advanced beacons broadcast 2 modules over a 9x9 area. Although machines boosted by multiple beacons will get diminishing effects per beacon, the [item=beacon] and [item=basic-beacon] do not diminish each other's effects, so using both types in combination gives greater total effects. See the graph in the Factoriopedia.
