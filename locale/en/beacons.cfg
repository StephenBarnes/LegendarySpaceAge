[technology-description]
basic-beacons=In this modpack, charged circuits replace all modules. Circuits can be charged in a [item=circuit-charger], then placed in a [item=basic-beacon] to apply effects to nearby machines. Circuits will lose charge over time, so you should use inserters to remove spent circuits and insert charged circuits. If a single machine is affected by many beacons, they will have diminishing returns - see the graph in the Factoriopedia. Later, you will be able to research [technology=supercharged-circuits] and [technology=advanced-beacons].
effect-transmission=Advanced beacons broadcast 2 modules over a 7x7 area. Although machines boosted by multiple beacons will get diminishing effects per beacon, the [item=beacon] and [item=basic-beacon] do not diminish each other's effects, so using both types in combination gives greater total effects. See the graph in the Factoriopedia.
