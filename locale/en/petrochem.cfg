[entity-description]
gasifier=Burns any solid fuel to turn steam into syngas.\nNot affected by productivity or efficiency bonuses. Fuel consumption scales with quality.
fluid-fuelled-gasifier=Burns gas/liquid fuel to turn steam into syngas. The middle input is for fuel, and the two opposed sides are for steam input and syngas output.\nNot affected by productivity or efficiency bonuses. Fuel consumption scales with quality.

[technology-name]
oil-processing=Petrochemistry
advanced-oil-processing=Advanced petrochemistry
coal-liquefaction=Syngas
coal-coking=Coal coking
petroleum-resin=Petroleum resin
diesel=Diesel

[technology-description]
oil-processing=Extract oil and gas and refine them to produce a variety of useful products.
advanced-oil-processing=Advanced recipes to convert between petroleum fractions and products.
coal-liquefaction=Syngas can be used to synthesize gas and oil fractions. Syngas can be made from coal, wood, spoilage, or any other carbon-based fuel, combined with steam.
coal-coking=Process coal by extracting the volatile sulfur, leaving purer carbon, which can be used for electronics, gunpowder, and filters. Coking increases the total fuel value if the sulfur is used as fuel, but note that furnaces don't accept sulfur as fuel.
petroleum-resin=Petroleum can be used to manufacture synthetic resins.
diesel=Diesel is an optimal blend of fuels for vehicles. When barrelled, it can be used in trains, cars, tanks, and ships, to greatly increase vehicle acceleration and top speed.
