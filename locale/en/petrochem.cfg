; Oil refinery now refines both oil and gas.
oil-refinery=Petrochemical refinery

[entity-description]
gasifier=Uses steam and carbon-based solid fuels to produce syngas.
fluid-fuelled-gasifier=Uses steam and fluid fuel to produce syngas. The middle input is for fuel; the two opposed sides are for steam input and syngas output.

oil-gathering=Gas and oil gathering
coal-liquefaction=Syngas

[technology-description]
oil-gathering=Gathering crude oil and natural gas using pumpjacks and wellheads.
coal-liquefaction=Syngas can be used to synthesize gas and oil fractions. Syngas can be made from coal, wood, spoilage, or any other hydrocarbon fuel, combined with steam.
