; Oil refinery now refines both oil and gas. Could call it "petrochemical refinery" but that's too long.
oil-refinery=Refinery

[entity-description]
gasifier=Uses steam and carbon-based solid fuels to produce syngas.
fluid-fuelled-gasifier=Uses steam and fluid fuel to produce syngas. The middle input is for fuel; the two opposed sides are for steam input and syngas output.

[technology-name]
oil-processing=Petrochemistry
coal-liquefaction=Syngas
rocket-fuel=Vehicle fuel

[technology-description]
oil-processing=Extract oil and gas and refine them to produce a variety of useful products.
coal-liquefaction=Syngas can be used to synthesize gas and oil fractions. Syngas can be made from coal, wood, spoilage, or any other carbon-based fuel, combined with steam.
rocket-fuel=Sophisticated fuel ideal for rockets, locomotives, and other vehicles.

[fuel-category-name]
non-carbon=Non-carbon fuel
chemical=Carbon-based fuel
