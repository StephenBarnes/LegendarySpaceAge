[item-description]
sulfur=Byproduct that can be used as fuel. Cannot be used to fuel furnaces or gasifiers, which require carbon-based fuel.

; Oil refinery now refines both oil and gas. Could call it "petrochemical refinery" but that's too long.
oil-refinery=Refinery

[entity-description]
gasifier=Uses carbon-based solid fuels with steam to produce syngas. Use __CONTROL__LSA-toggle-entity__ to switch to fluid-fuelled gasifier.
fluid-fuelled-gasifier=Uses fluid fuel and steam to produce syngas. The middle input is for fuel; the two opposed sides are for steam input and syngas output. Use __CONTROL__LSA-toggle-entity__ to switch to solid-fuel gasifier.

[technology-name]
oil-processing=Petrochemistry
coal-liquefaction=Syngas
rocket-fuel=Vehicle fuel
coal-coking=Coal coking

[technology-description]
oil-processing=Extract oil and gas and refine them to produce a variety of useful products.
coal-liquefaction=Syngas can be used to synthesize gas and oil fractions. Syngas can be made from coal, wood, spoilage, or any other carbon-based fuel, combined with steam.
rocket-fuel=Sophisticated fuel ideal for rockets, locomotives, and other vehicles.
coal-coking=Process coal by extracting the volatile sulfur, leaving purer carbon, which can be used for gunpowder and filtration. Coking increases the total fuel value if the sulfur is used as fuel, but note that furnaces don't accept sulfur as fuel.
