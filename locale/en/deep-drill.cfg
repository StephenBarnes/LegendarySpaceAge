	; Call it "Borehole mining drill", so message says "Borehole mining drill is in the way".
drill-node-ice=Ice node

[entity-description]
deep-drill=Can be placed on any solid ground to produce minerals depending on the planet, or on mineral nodes to produce specific resources. Cannot be placed close to other borehole drills.
deep-drill-exclusion=Region created around borehole drills (or ghosts of borehole drills) to prevent them from being built too close to each other.
drill-node-ice=An underground ice deposit. Build a [item=deep-drill] on top of it to extract resources indefinitely.
