[technology-description]
electrophages=Even in the lightning-blasted ruins of Fulgora, life can still be found. With proper care, a starter culture of electrophages can be cultivated for a self-sustaining supply of nutrients, enabling local bio-industry.
holmium-battery=With holmium, you can make batteries that last forever and hold more energy. Unlike regular batteries, their charge will never spoil, and they are never destroyed by charging.
fulgorite-farming=Fulgorites are coral-like structures formed by colonies of electrophages in symbiosis with a native crystalline fungus. They can be cultivated to produce holmium renewably.
; For battery tech, we're adding chargers and dischargers.
battery=Batteries can be charged and discharged, allowing energy to be transported or saved for later.

[item-description]
polysalt=Long-lasting nutrients derived from Fulgoran microbes.
fulgorite-starter=Used by agricultural towers to grow fulgorites. When harvested, yields fulgorite shards, which must be processed into more starters before they can be planted again.
; For battery discharger, note that it has low priority.
battery-discharger=Releases energy by discharging batteries. Only operates when available electricity from primary sources (such as steam engines and lightning rods) is insufficient to meet demand.
