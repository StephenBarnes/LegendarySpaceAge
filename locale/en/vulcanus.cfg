[fluid-name]
volcanic-gas=Volcanic gas
molten-steel=Molten steel
molten-tungsten=Molten tungsten

[entity-name]
sulfuric-acid-geyser=Volcanic fumarole
apprentice-foundry-beacon-interface=(Foundry hidden beacon)

[entity-description]
foundry=With every recipe finished, the foundry heats up, gaining +0.9% speed and +0.1% productivity, up to a maximum of +900% speed and +100% productivity after 1000 consecutive crafts. When the foundry is idle, it cools down, losing 90% speed and 10% productivity per second.

[recipe-name]
volcanic-gas-separation=Volcanic gas separation
metals-from-lava=Metals from lava
casting-advanced-parts=Casting advanced parts
lava-water-heating=Lava-water heat exchange
tungsten-heating=Heat molten tungsten
tungsten-carbide-from-molten=Cast tungsten carbide
tungsten-steel-from-molten=Cast tungsten steel
inverse-vulcanization=Inverse vulcanization

[recipe-description]
tungsten-carbide-from-molten=More efficient recipe for tungsten carbide, using molten tungsten within a specific temperature range.
tungsten-steel-from-molten=Cast tungsten steel, using molten tungsten within a specific temperature range.

[technology-name]
volcanic-gas-processing=Volcanic gas processing
tungsten-steel=Advanced tungsten processing
inverse-vulcanization=Inverse vulcanization

[technology-description]
volcanic-gas-processing=Pumpjacks capture volcanic gas from fumaroles. The gas can be condensed and separated into water, carbon, and sulfur. This will be your only source of water and hydrocarbons on this planet.
calcite-processing=Calcite can be used to make ceramic circuit boards, reducing the demand for scarce hydrocarbons on Vulcanus.
tungsten-steel=Using molten tungsten, you can manufacture tungsten carbide more efficiently, and start producing tungsten steel. Note that the recipes require the input molten tungsten to be inside a specific temperature range.
inverse-vulcanization=Use sulfur to produce plastics and resin, reducing your dependence on scarce hydrocarbons.
foundry=The foundry can produce metal products with high speed and productivity, but to achieve its full potential, it needs to be kept hot by continuous crafting.
