[technology-name]
volcanic-gas-processing=Volcanic gas processing

[technology-description]
volcanic-gas-processing=Wellheads capture volcanic gas from fumaroles. The gas can be separated into water, carbon, and sulfur. This will be your only source of water and hydrocarbons on this planet.
calcite-processing=Calcite can be used to make ceramic circuit boards, reducing the demand for scarce hydrocarbons on Vulcanus.
