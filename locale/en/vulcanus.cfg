volcanic-gas=Volcanic gas
molten-steel=Molten steel
molten-tungsten=Molten tungsten

[entity-name]
sulfuric-acid-geyser=Volcanic fumarole
apprentice-arc-furnace-beacon-interface=(Arc furnace hidden beacon)
arc-furnace=Arc furnace
lava-pump=Lava pump

[entity-description]
foundry=Casts metal products from molten metals.\nProductivity bonuses do not apply to steam output.
arc-furnace=Produces molten metals. With every recipe finished, the arc furnace heats up, gaining +10% speed and +1% productivity, up to a maximum of +900% speed and +100% productivity after 100 consecutive crafts. When the arc furnace is idle, it cools down, losing 100% speed and 10% productivity per second. Power consumption does not change.
lava-pump=Extracts lava from lava lakes. [color=yellow]Cannot connect to pipes, only directly to other machines.[/color]

[recipe-name]
volcanic-gas-separation=Volcanic gas filtration
metals-from-lava=Metals from lava
casting-advanced-parts=Casting advanced parts
lava-water-heating=Lava-water heat exchange
tungsten-heating=Heat molten tungsten
tungsten-carbide-from-molten=Cast tungsten carbide
tungsten-steel-from-molten=Cast tungsten steel
inverse-vulcanization=Inverse vulcanization
sulfur-concrete=Cast sulfur to concrete
sulfur-refined-concrete=Cast sulfur to refined concrete
casting-brick=Cast brick

[recipe-description]
tungsten-carbide-from-molten=More efficient recipe for tungsten carbide, using molten tungsten within a specific temperature range.
tungsten-steel-from-molten=Cast tungsten steel, using molten tungsten within a specific temperature range.
tungsten-heating=Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.

[technology-name]
volcanic-gas-processing=Volcanic gas processing
tungsten-steel=Advanced tungsten processing
inverse-vulcanization=Inverse vulcanization
tungsten-axe=Tungsten axe
foundry=Metallurgy
big-mining-drill=Tungsten mining drill
sulfur-concrete=Sulfur-based concrete

[technology-description]
volcanic-gas-processing=Pumpjacks capture volcanic gas from fumaroles. The gas can be condensed and separated into water, carbon, and sulfur. This will be your only source of water on this planet, and your only source of hydrocarbons until you build a [item=deep-drill].
calcite-processing=Calcite can be used to make ceramic circuit boards, reducing the demand for scarce hydrocarbons on Vulcanus.
tungsten-steel=Using molten tungsten, you can manufacture tungsten carbide more efficiently, and start producing tungsten steel. Note that the recipes require the input molten tungsten to be inside a specific temperature range.
inverse-vulcanization=Use sulfur to produce plastics and resin, reducing your dependence on scarce hydrocarbons.
foundry=The arc furnace can produce molten metals with high speed and productivity, but to achieve its full potential, it needs to be kept hot by continuous crafting. The foundry casts molten metals into solid products.
foundry-2=More advanced recipes for working with molten metals and glass. TODO add recipes for molten glass, casting glass, casting lava to structure, casting fluid fittings, casting steel shielding, etc.
mech-armor-2=From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine.
sulfur-concrete=Make concrete using molten sulfur as the binder, instead of water.
