	; Call it "Telescope", so message says "Telescope is in the way".

[entity-description]
cargo-bay=Built on cargo landing pads on-planet. Cannot be built on space platforms. Increases storage space and max cargo pod landing rate.
telescope=Produces lunar science packs. Can only be built on Apollo, on the mountain ranges surrounding mega-craters, and not too close to other telescopes.
telescope-exclusion=Region created around telescopes (or ghosts of telescopes) to prevent them from being built too close to each other.

[space-location-description]
apollo=The barren moon of Nauvis. Apollo's surface is marked with craters, the largest of which have mountainous rims suitable for telescopes. Deposits of deep ice can be found in the cold interiors of mega-craters. A lunar base cannot be self-sufficient, but can produce lunar science and certain export goods. Due to the low gravity and lack of atmosphere, rocket launches are 10x cheaper than on most planets.
shattered-planet=All that remains of a shattered planet is this asteroid belt. Its remnants bar the way out of the solar system, but also hold resources that can provide the means to leave the solar system and traverse deep space.
; TODO more descriptions.

space-science-pack=Moon discovery: Apollo
space-platform-thruster=Asteroid science pack
asteroid-crushing=Asteroid crushing

[technology-description]
space-platform=Create a spaceship capable of travelling to Apollo. You won't need asteroid defenses yet, since there are no asteroids except in asteroid belts.
space-science-pack-space-age=Apollo is the barren moon of Nauvis. The moon lacks the resources for self-sufficiency, but a lunar base can produce science and export other products like liquid hydrogen/oxygen. Necessary infrastructure will need to be shipped from Nauvis - including a rover for exploration, solar panels for power, logistics infrastructure, nitrogen and blue circuits for lunar science, and rocket parts to ship science back. Due to the low gravity and lack of atmosphere, rocket launches are 10x cheaper than on most planets.
space-platform-thruster=Visit the three inner asteroid belts to produce asteroid science.
asteroid-crushing=Spaceships can crush asteroid chunks to manufacture some essential supplies, such as ammunition and liquid hydrogen/oxygen.
