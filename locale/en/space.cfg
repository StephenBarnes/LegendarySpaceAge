[space-location-description]
apollo=The mostly-barren moon of Nauvis. A lunar base cannot be self-sufficient, but provides a useful stepping stone for lunar science and perhaps spaceship refueling. Apollo's surface is marked with craters, the largest of which have mountainous rims suitable for telescopes. Deposits of deep ice can be found in the cold interiors of mega-craters.
shattered-planet=All that remains of a shattered planet is this asteroid belt. Its remnants bar the way out of the solar system, but also hold resources that can provide the means to leave the solar system and traverse deep space.

planet-discovery-apollo=Moon discovery: Apollo

[technology-description]
planet-discovery-apollo=Apollo is the mostly-barren moon of Nauvis. While Apollo can provide lunar science, and perhaps spaceship refueling, it lacks the resources for self-sufficiency. Necessary infrastructure will need to be shipped from Nauvis - including a rover for exploration, solar panels for power, logistical infrastructure, blue circuits for lunar science, and rocket parts to ship science back to Nauvis.

[tile-description]
apollo-clay=The cold floor of a mega-crater. The sunlight doesn't reach here, making it unsuitable for solar panels, but also cold enough to support ice deposits.
