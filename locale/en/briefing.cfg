[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
legendary-space-age-briefing=Welcome to [color=green]Legendary Space Age[/color], engineer! This is an overhaul mod/modpack for people who've played Space Age and want a harder challenge. Some important things to know:\n\n* In your crashed ship you'll find some bots and personal equipment. To start using them, make [item=light-armor] and [item=personal-burner-generator].\n* Legendary Space Age makes changes to many recipes and overall progression. Read Factoriopedia entries and tooltips.\n* At night, enemies can spawn on any patch of dark, open land with pollution. Build [item=lamp] to prevent spawns in an area. Defend yourself from all sides. Destroying nests will no longer be enough to prevent attacks.\n* Nauvis enemies will evolve different damage resistances. Gun turrets (physical damage) are enough for the early game, but later you'll need laser damage for biters, fire damage for armoured biters, and explosive damage for spitters.\n* Each power pole has a maximum power rating. Exceeding the max will cause power poles to explode. Use a [item=po-transformer] to connect power networks.\n* You can dump unwanted items in any lake. This works on all planets. Unwanted liquids can also be dumped using a [item=waste-pump], and unwanted gases can be vented in a [item=gas-vent].\n* Advanced logistics chests are post-Aquilo. You can still use roboports, remote construction and repairs, and personal/vehicle logistics.\n\nSome tips for after you've left [planet=nauvis]:\n* You'll get another 25x [item=construction-robot] every time you land on a new planet. (TODO implement)\n* You have to start each planet from scratch, without imports. To enable imports, research the "orbital navigation" tech using that planet's science.\n* On [planet=vulcanus], [fluid=lava] cannot flow through pipes. Connect foundries directly to offshore pumps.
