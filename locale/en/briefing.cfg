[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
LSA-main=Welcome to [color=green]Legendary Space Age[/color], engineer! This is an overhaul mod/modpack for people who've played Space Age and want a harder challenge.\n\nSee the pages below for some useful information. More pages will be added as you progress through the game.

LSA-early-bots=In your crashed ship you'll find some construction bots and a personal roboport. To start using them, make [item=light-armor] and a [item=personal-burner-generator].
LSA-factors=Most infrastructure is crafted using [font=default-bold][color=yellow]factor intermediates[/color][/font]. Each of these intermediates has multiple recipes, with different tradeoffs. Simple recipes generally use more raw materials per output. Choose recipes appropriate to your current planet and available resources.

LSA-enemy-spawns=At night, enemies can spawn on any patch of dark, open land with pollution. Build [item=small-lamp] to prevent spawns in an area. Set up defenses on all sides. Destroying nests will no longer be enough to prevent attacks. (TODO add.)
LSA-enemy-resistances=Nauvis enemies will evolve different damage resistances. (TODO implement.) Gun turrets (physical damage) are enough for the early game, but later you'll need laser damage for biters, fire damage for armoured biters, and explosive damage for spitters.
LSA-power-overload=Each power pole has a maximum power rating. Exceeding the max will cause power poles to explode. Use a [item=po-transformer] to connect power networks.

LSA-dumping=You can dump unwanted items in any lake, using an [item=inserter]. This works on all planets.\n\nUnwanted liquids can be dumped in a lake by building a [item=waste-pump]. Unwanted gases can be vented using a [item=gas-vent]. In space, the [item=gas-vent] can also vent liquids. Dumping certain liquids and gases will generate pollution.

LSA-fuels=Barrels and gas tanks can be used as fuel. Vehicles like cars and trains will run best on [item=diesel-barrel], [item=petroleum-gas-barrel], or [item=light-oil-barrel].
LSA-fluid-wagons=Fluid wagons don't exist in this modpack. Use barrels and gas tanks.

LSA-advanced-logistics=Advanced logistics chests are post-Aquilo. You can still use roboports, remote construction and repairs, and personal/vehicle logistics, but you can't use requester or active provider chests.

LSA-solar-power=[font=default-bold]Solar panels are very weak on the surface of planets.[/font] It is recommended to instead use boilers or heating towers for most of your power needs. You can use the [item=gas-boiler] and [item=fluid-heating-tower] to burn fluids directly. Consider planting trees to reduce pollution.

LSA-space-platforms=While solar panels are weak on the ground, they are strong in space.
;TODO add more here, about eg recipes and asteroids.

LSA-planet-drops=You have to start each planet from scratch, without importing materials. To enable imports, research the cargo pod tech for that planet, which requires that planet's science.\n\nException: You can drop [item=construction-robot] before researching the cargo pod tech.

LSA-vulcanus=On [planet=vulcanus], carbon-based fuels are scarce. Consider building [item=deep-drill] to extract more.
LSA-vulcanus-lava=On [planet=vulcanus], [fluid=lava] cannot flow through pipes. Connect foundries directly to offshore pumps.

LSA-gleba=On [planet=gleba], there are no sustainable sources of iron or copper. You can mine stromatolites for ores to get started, but eventually you'll need to use alternative no-metal recipes. Build a [item=deep-drill] to extract chitin.

LSA-aquilo-trip=Solar power is extremely weak this far from the sun, even in space, so it is recommended to outfit your space platform with a [item=nuclear-reactor].
