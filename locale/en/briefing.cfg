[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
legendary-space-age-briefing=Welcome to [color=green]Legendary Space Age[/color], engineer! This is an overhaul mod/modpack for people who've played Space Age and want a harder challenge. Some important things to know:\n\n* In your crashed ship you'll find some bots and personal equipment. To start using them, make [item=light-armor] and [item=personal-burner-generator].\n* Legendary Space Age makes changes to many recipes and overall progression. Read Factoriopedia entries and tooltips.\n* At night, enemies can spawn on any patch of dark, open land with pollution. Build [item=small-lamp] to prevent spawns in an area. Set up defenses on all sides. Destroying nests will no longer be enough to prevent attacks. (TODO add.)\n* Nauvis enemies will evolve different damage resistances. (TODO implement.) Gun turrets (physical damage) are enough for the early game, but later you'll need laser damage for biters, fire damage for armoured biters, and explosive damage for spitters.\n* Each power pole has a maximum power rating. Exceeding the max will cause power poles to explode. Use a [item=po-transformer] to connect power networks.\n* You can dump unwanted items in any lake. This works on all planets. Unwanted liquids can be dumped in a lake by building a [item=waste-pump]. Unwanted gases can be vented using a [item=gas-vent]. In space, the [item=gas-vent] can also vent liquids. Dumping certain liquids and gases will generate pollution.\n* Fluid wagons don't exist. Use barrels and gas tanks.\n* Barrels and gas tanks can be used as fuel. Vehicles like cars and trains will run best on rocket fuel, rich gas, or light oil.\n* Advanced logistics chests are post-Aquilo. You can still use roboports, remote construction and repairs, and personal/vehicle logistics, but you can't use requester or active provider chests.\n\nSome tips for after you've left [planet=nauvis]:\n* You have to start each planet from scratch, without importing materials. To enable imports, research the cargo pod tech for that planet, which requires that planet's science.\n* As an exception, you can drop [item=construction-robot] on any planet without researching the cargo pod tech.\n* On [planet=vulcanus], [fluid=lava] cannot flow through pipes. Connect foundries directly to offshore pumps.\n* On [planet=vulcanus], carbon-based fuels are scarce. Consider building [item=deep-drill] to extract more.\n* On [planet=gleba], there are no sustainable sources of iron or copper, so you'll have to find alternatives. Build a [item=deep-drill] to extract chitin.

; TODO also list boilers and generators.
LSA-energy=Solar panels are much weaker on the surface. (But it's still good in space.)

; TODO more
LSA-space-platforms=Solar panels, while weak on the ground, are strong in space.

; TODO more
LSA-aquilo=Solar power is extremely weak even in space, so your space platform should be outfitted with a nuclear reactor or a large supply of charged batteries.
