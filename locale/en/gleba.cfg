	; Ideally this would change description if the spoil timer gets adjusted, but it seems we can't do that since the multiplier is runtime-stage.
activated-pentapod-egg=Produced when a dormant egg spoils or is deliberately activated using mash. Will hatch quickly unless duplicated or burned.
cyclosome=Glowing nodules harvested from the stingfrond tree. They loop between 5 phases, from A to E.
; For Slipstack Agriculture mod
slipstack-seed=Can be planted in shallow blue water or pink/purple marshlands to grow slipstacks.

cyclosome-resynchronization=Induce cyclosomes to replicate, by collecting 5 of each phase. Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.
explosive-desynchronization=Using explosives, cyclosomes can be shocked into different phases. Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.

[technology-description]
stingfronds-1=Stingfronds are a bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. Their long strands, called neurofibrils, can be burned as fuel or processed into carbon fiber. They also grow cyclosomes, small glowing orbs with a rhythmic bioluminescence, which can be sprouted to plant more stingfronds.
stingfronds-2=By collecting cyclosomes of different phases, they can be induced to replicate. Using explosives, cyclosomes can be shocked into different phases.
; For Slipstack Agriculture mod
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks produce pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in shallow blue water or pink/purple marshlands. Slipstacks are a renewable source of stone and pearls, which have applications in bio-manufacturing. They also absorb spores, reducing attacks.

[entity-description]
stingfrond=A bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. From its tough stinging cords hang tiny nodules, twinkling in rhythmic patterns.
; For slipstacks
slipstack=A coral stack that excretes blue blobs of mucus called pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
