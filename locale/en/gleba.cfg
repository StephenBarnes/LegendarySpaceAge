spoilage=[font=default-bold][color=#f7e2c2]Spoils to nothing:[/color][/font] 20m
	; Ideally this would change description if the spoil timer gets adjusted, but it seems we can't do that since the multiplier is runtime-stage.
activated-pentapod-egg=Produced when a dormant egg spoils or is deliberately activated using mash. Will hatch quickly unless duplicated or burned.
cyclosome=Glowing nodules harvested from the stingfrond tree. They loop between 5 phases, from A to E.
slipstack-nest=Can be planted in pink/purple lowland marshes.

cyclosome-resynchronization=Replicate cyclosomes by collecting 5 of each phase. Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.
explosive-desynchronization=Using explosives, cyclosomes can be shocked out of sync. Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.

[technology-description]
neural-wiring=Stingfronds are a bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. Their long strands are called neurofibrils, and are electrically conductive. They can be burned as fuel or processed into wiring.
stingfrond-cultivation-1=In addition to neurofibrils, stingfronds yield cyclosomes, small glowing orbs with a rhythmic bioluminescence. They can be sprouted to plant more stingfronds.
stingfrond-cultivation-2=By collecting cyclosomes of different phases, they can be induced to replicate. Using explosives, cyclosomes can be shocked into different phases.
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks are stony structures deposited by a gel-like organism. The stone columns provide the gel with both protection and a means to trap unwary insects. The sticky gel hardens to form pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in pink/purple marshland. Slipstacks provide stone and pearls. They also absorb spores, reducing attacks.

[entity-description]
stingfrond=A bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. From its tough stinging cords hang tiny nodules, twinkling in rhythmic patterns.
slipstack=A coral stack inhabited by a blue mucus-like organism that hardens into pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
