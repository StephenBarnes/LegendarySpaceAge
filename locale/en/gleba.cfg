[technology-description]
neural-wiring=Stingfronds are a bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. Their long strands are called neurofibrils, and are electrically conductive. They can be burned as fuel or processed into wiring.
stingfrond-cultivation-1=In addition to neurofibrils, stingfronds yield cyclosomes, small glowing orbs with a rhythmic bioluminescence. They can be sprouted to plant more stingfronds.
stingfrond-cultivation-2=By collecting cyclosomes of different phases, they can be induced to replicate. Using explosive boomsacs, cyclosomes can be shocked into different phases.
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks are stony structures deposited by a gel-like organism. The stone columns provide the gel with both protection and a means to trap unwary insects. The sticky gel hardens to form pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in pink/purple marshland. Slipstacks provide pearls and stone.
boompuff-cultivation=Boompuffs can be farmed in red/yellow highland terrain. The sacs, while explosive, can be processed for natural gas and sulfuric acid. The nuts can be crushed for niter, or sprouted to plant more boompuffs. Boompuffs also slowly absorb spores, reducing nearby attacks.
chitin-processing-1=Chitin fragments can be compressed into blocks and cemented together with Gleban slime.
chitin-processing-2=Dissolving chitin fragments in a nutrient-rich broth creates a medium for controlled growth of slipstack pearls. Under perfect conditions, the pearls will assemble the chitin into super-strong lightweight tubules.
carbon-fiber=Neurofibrils are composed of carbon nanotubes and connective tissues. The strands can be separated and woven into a lightweight, strong fabric.
bacteria-cultivation=Petrophages are rare bacteria obtained by filtering slime. They can be cultivated by feeding them dry gas, but spoilage is passed on to the offspring, so they must be refreshed regularly. Petrophages are the only way to obtain heavy and light oil sustainably on Gleba. They're also useful in space.
bioflux-processing=Alternative recipes for plastic and lubricant on Gleba, using bioflux.
jellynut=The jellystem yields gelatinous jellynuts. To replant them, you'll need to plant the seeds immediately after removing them from the fruit, or else re-fertilize them using bioflux.
yumako=The yumako tree yields nutritious yumako fruit. To replant them, you'll need to plant the seeds immediately after removing them from the fruit, or else re-fertilize them using bioflux.
marrow=The deeper tissues of the Gleba Superorganism have several industrial applications. Build a [item=deep-drill] to extract these resources.
biomechanisms=Geoplasm can be found in the interior of the Gleba Superorganism. With the right encouragement, this fluid will self-assemble into appendages and sense organs, potentially removing the need for scarce metals on Gleba.
biochamber=Crafting machines with vats of live microbes used for biology-related recipes.
wriggler-missile=The strafers' tactics can be turned against them. A wriggler missile will inflict some damage on impact and spawn a premature wriggler that fights for you. Premature wrigglers die after 50 seconds.
egg-duplication=The pentapods are the natural immune system of Gleba. While they've been a nuisance so far, exploiting their biology will be the key to conquering this planet.

[entity-description]
stingfrond=A bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. From its tough stinging cords hang tiny nodules, twinkling in rhythmic patterns.
slipstack=A coral stack inhabited by a mucus that hardens into pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
boompuff=An explosive plant that ferments volatile gases inside its bulbous sacs. The sacs can be thrown like grenades, though care must be taken as they will also detonate in your inventory.
