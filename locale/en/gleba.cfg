	; Ideally this would change description if the spoil timer gets adjusted, but it seems we can't do that since the multiplier is runtime-stage.
activated-pentapod-egg=Produced when a dormant egg spoils or is deliberately activated using mash. Will hatch quickly unless duplicated or burned.
; For Slipstack Agriculture mod
slipstack-seed=Can be planted in shallow blue water or pink/purple marshlands to grow slipstacks.

cyclosome-resynchronization=By collecting 25 cyclosomes of different phases, they can be induced to replicate.
explosive-desynchronization=Use explosives to shock cyclosomes, forcing them into different phases.

; For Slipstack Agriculture mod
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks produce pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in shallow blue water or pink/purple marshlands. Slipstacks are a renewable source of stone and pearls, which have applications in bio-manufacturing. They also absorb spores, reducing attacks.

[entity-description]
stingfrond=A bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. From its tough stinging cords hang tiny nodules, twinkling in rhythmic patterns.
; For slipstacks
slipstack=A coral stack that excretes blue blobs of mucus called pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
