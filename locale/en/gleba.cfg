spoilage=[font=default-bold][color=#f7e2c2]Spoils to nothing:[/color][/font] 20m
	; Ideally this would change description if the spoil timer gets adjusted, but it seems we can't do that since the multiplier is runtime-stage.
activated-pentapod-egg=Produced when a dormant egg spoils or is deliberately activated using mash. Will hatch quickly unless duplicated or burned.
cyclosome=Glowing nodules harvested from the stingfrond tree. They loop between 5 phases, from A to E.
slipstack-nest=Can be planted in pink/purple lowland marshes.
sprouted-boomnut=Can be planted in yellow or red lichen in the highlands.
boomsac=Spoils into a potentially-lethal explosion. Can be thrown like a grenade, or processed for natural gas and sulfur.
bioflux=Nutritious blend of cultured Gleban crops. Can be eaten for a burst of health regeneration and movement speed.
jellynut-seed=Must be fertilized before it can be planted.
yumako-seed=Must be fertilized before it can be planted.

[recipe-description]
cyclosome-resynchronization=Replicate cyclosomes by collecting 5 of each phase. Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.
explosive-desynchronization=Using explosives, cyclosomes can be shocked out of sync. Productivity bonuses are disabled for this recipe.
petrophage-cultivation=Breed petrophages by feeding them dry gas. Note that spoilage is passed on to the offspring.
refresh-petrophages=Filter 3 petrophages to produce one completely fresh petrophage. This is the only way to reduce spoilage of petrophages.
bioflux-from-eggs=This recipe allows you to obtain initial bioflux, but is much more expensive than the main bioflux recipe.
fertilized-yumako-seed=Productivity is disabled for this recipe. The fertilized seed is produced 100% fresh.
fertilized-jellynut-seed=Productivity is disabled for this recipe. The fertilized seed is produced 100% fresh.

[technology-description]
neural-wiring=Stingfronds are a bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. Their long strands are called neurofibrils, and are electrically conductive. They can be burned as fuel or processed into wiring.
stingfrond-cultivation-1=In addition to neurofibrils, stingfronds yield cyclosomes, small glowing orbs with a rhythmic bioluminescence. They can be sprouted to plant more stingfronds.
stingfrond-cultivation-2=By collecting cyclosomes of different phases, they can be induced to replicate. Using explosives, cyclosomes can be shocked into different phases.
slipstack-propagation=Slipstacks are stony structures deposited by a gel-like organism. The stone columns provide the gel with both protection and a means to trap unwary insects. The sticky gel hardens to form pearls, which can be combined with a mineral base and planted in pink/purple marshland. Slipstacks provide pearls and stone.
boompuff-cultivation=Boompuffs can be farmed in red/yellow highland terrain. The sacs, while explosive, can be processed for natural gas and sulfuric acid. The nuts can be crushed for niter, or sprouted to plant more boompuffs. Boompuffs also slowly absorb spores, reducing nearby attacks.
chitin-processing-1=Chitin fragments can be baked into blocks and cemented together with Gleban slime.
chitin-processing-2=Dissolving chitin fragments in a nutrient-rich broth creates a medium for controlled growth of slipstack pearls. Under perfect conditions, the pearls will assemble the chitin into super-strong lightweight tubules.
geoplasm=Valuable resources can be found in the mantle of the Gleba Superorganism. By building a [item=deep-drill], these constituents can be extracted and used for various industrial purposes, completely removing the need for scarce metals on Gleba.
carbon-fiber=Neurofibrils are composed of carbon nanotubes and connective tissues. The strands can be separated and woven into a lightweight, strong fabric.
bacteria-cultivation=Petrophages are rare bacteria obtained by filtering slime. They can be cultivated by feeding them dry gas, but spoilage is passed on to the offspring, so they must be refreshed regularly. Petrophages are the only way to obtain heavy and light oil sustainably on Gleba. They're also useful in space.
bioflux-processing=Alternative recipes for plastic and lubricant on Gleba, using bioflux.
jellynut=The jellystem yields gelatinous jellynuts. To replant them, you'll need to plant the seeds immediately after removing them from the fruit, or else re-fertilize them using bioflux, which you should unlock a few minutes after this.
yumako=The yumako tree yields nutritious yumako fruit. To replant them, you'll need to plant the seeds immediately after removing them from the fruit, or else re-fertilize them using bioflux, which you should unlock a few minutes after this.

[entity-description]
stingfrond=A bioluminescent tree found in the Gleban midlands. From its tough stinging cords hang tiny nodules, twinkling in rhythmic patterns.
slipstack=A coral stack inhabited by a mucus that hardens into pearls. By embedding the pearls in a mineral base, they can be replanted and farmed.
boompuff=An explosive plant that ferments volatile gases inside its bulbous sacs. The sacs can be thrown like grenades, though care must be taken as they will also detonate in your inventory.
