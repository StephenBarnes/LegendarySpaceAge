electronic-circuit-primed=Placed in beacons to reduce energy consumption of nearby machines, up to a limit of the machine's min consumption plus 20% of the max minus min consumption.
advanced-circuit-primed=[font=default-bold]Usable with all recipes and machines[/font] up to a max of +300% productivity, unless tooltips say otherwise.
processing-unit-primed=Placed in beacons to increase speed of nearby machines.

[technology-description]
white-circuit=With technology gleaned from the Fulgoran ruins, craft exotic circuits. When primed, they provide quality bonuses.
superclocked-circuits=Using the [item=superclocker], you can boost the effects of primed circuits even further, but at the cost of destroying some circuits. Superclocked circuits will quickly decay back into primed circuits.
