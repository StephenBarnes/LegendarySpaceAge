[technology-description]
white-circuit=Craft white circuits using technology gleaned from the Fulgoran ruins.
superclocked-circuits=The [item=superclocker] doubles the effects of primed circuits, at the cost of destroying some circuits. Superclocked circuits will quickly decay back into primed circuits.
