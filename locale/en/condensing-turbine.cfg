[technology-description]
condensing-turbine=Where water is scarce, ordinary steam turbines are wasteful, releasing steam into the atmosphere. Condensing turbines recapture and condense the steam, recovering all of the water for reuse. This comes at the cost of lower electricity generation efficiency.
