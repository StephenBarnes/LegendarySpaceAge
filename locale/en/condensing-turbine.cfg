[technology-description]
steam-power-2=Steam turbines have a higher efficiency than steam engines.
steam-power-3=Ordinary steam turbines release steam into the atmosphere, which is wasteful in situations where water is scarce. Condensing turbines recapture and condense the steam, recovering all of the water for reuse. This comes at the cost of lower efficiency.
