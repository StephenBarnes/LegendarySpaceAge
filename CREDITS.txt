This file is to keep track of other people's stuff that I've used.

* Unused Renders by Malcolm Riley.
* AdamoCarbon by ElAdamo - not using his mod or code, but stole several ideas for the petrochem system.
* Flare Stack by GotLag, snouz, and others - used graphics and code.
* Gleba crop mods by LordMiguel (slipstacks, boompuffs, stingfronds) - TODO.
